# powershell5_log_parser2
<p>Say you have a log file that has the phrase "authorized by no authentication" in certain entries. Extracting those entries and then emailing you:

a) the entries

b) the first and last entries

c) the count of the entries</p>

<p>...would be great.</p>

<p>Also, you want to reach back into the log by a certain number of days. You can do that.</p>

<p>And you want to search log entries between a certain number of days ago and the present or even specify and end date. You can do that.</p>

<p>And you want to supply a list of files, from which the script will pick the most recently accessed.  And you can use wildcards in the file name.</p>
<p>And you want to display the number of unique entries from the selected entries</p>

<p>You want to get an email if the log is not found. You can do that.</p>

<p>With this script in hand, parsing and emailing logs is easy.</p>

<p>This script is designed well in terms of keeping display separate from data.</p>
